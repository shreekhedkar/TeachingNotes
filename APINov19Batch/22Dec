Revision :
Exception
    - Deviation from expected behaviour but that can be controlled.
    - Checked and Unchecked
    -Checked
       - Java checks the possibilty of exception during compile time
    - Unchecked
        - Java cant take gurantee of identifying the possibilty of exception
Handling an Exception

Scanner scan ;
try {
    .. Statements that might raise and exception
      scan = new Scanner(System.in);

}
finally{

  scan.close();
}

If the expected exception is raised program will not be terminated but will continue

main() throws IOException{

    FileReader  reader = new FileReader("filename.txt");

    reader.close();
}


File Handling
    - Read and write operations
    - Charcter stream
    - Byte stream

FileReader fr = new FileReader(pathoffile);
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(fr);

String line=null;
  while(line =reader.readline())!=null){

      sysout(line)
  }

  - Array - is a collection with similar datatype.
  - Vector -
  - HashTable -

int [] array = new int[5];
array[0] = 10;

Vector vector = new vector();
vector.add(10);
