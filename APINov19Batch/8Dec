  Strings
    - Immutable - Cant change the value
    - It is a class and NOT a datatype
    String str = "Str"
      - str will be stored in string literal pool
      - literal pool is a part of heap memroy area
      - For redundant string declarations memory will not be
        allocated again
    String str = new String("str");
       - str will be stored outside literal pool but inside heap
       - each time memory will be allocated irrespective of the
         existence of the string in the memory
Equality of Strings:
       - Never Never use == to compare two Strings
       - Because it compares the address of the strings and
         NOT the values of the strings
       - For comparison based on the values of the string
         use equals method.

Static And Non-Static Rules

Rule 1 : Static functions can have non static members(variables) ONLY.
Rule 2:  Static things in Java can ACCESS static things ONLY.
Rule 3:  Static global variables can be accessed by all functions
          of the class and value of the variable is persisted
          across the fuctions of a class.
Rule 4 : All global variables need not be static.
Rule 5 : Global variables are initialized with the default value
         as per the data type.
          int 0 , String null, char '',Boolean false.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Class - It is a structure which binds data and behaviour.
Object - It is an instance of a class.

Car class - person

public class Person{

   int age; // instance variables
    String name; //instance variable

    Person(int age, String name){ // constructor
        age = age;
        name = name;

        }
        }
    public static void walk(){
      sysout("Person can walk");
    }
    public void eat(){
    }
}

public class PersonImplementation {

  main(){


      Person person2 = new Person(10,"abc");


  }

}


}

-------------------

Inheritance
  - Parent class -Base - root Class

  is-a relationship


  class Employee extends Person{
    int eno;
    double salary;

    public void work(){

    }

    public void walk(){
        sysout("Employee can walk")
    }
  }

  main(){

    Person p = new Person(); // age , name , walk



  }
