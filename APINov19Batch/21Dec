  Interface - Bridge between unrelated entities
            - has-a relationship
            - provides abstraction by hiding implementation details
            - provides way to achieve benefits of multiple inheritane.
            - methods are by default public and abstract.
            - Can't instiantiate interface.
            - methods are declared in interface and implementation
               is provided in classes which implements the interface.
            - interface can have static method defined.It is called as default methods
            - it is a contract between entities
            - interface can extend an interface but can't implement an interface.

temp.java
public interface temp extends test{

  public void sub();
}

class A implements temp {


}

test.java
public interface test {

    void add();
}

public class AnyClass implements test {

    public void add(){

            ---
    }
}

Abstract
    - Provides benefits of class as well interface
    - method declaration and defination both are possible.
    - if a method in a class is abstract then that class has to
      be marked as abstract.
    - class can extend abstract class but cant implement it.
    - class extending abstract class has to provide the definations for
      abstract methods
    - Object creation not allowed for abstract classes.
    - abstract classes can be inherited.

public class abstract A {

    abstract void add();

    void sub(){


    }
}

public abstract class B extends A {

abstract void mult();

void division(){


}
}


public class C extends B {

  void mult(){



  }

  void add(){


  }

}


class D {

  main(){

      C obj = new C();

      obj.add();
      obj.sub();
      obj.mult();
      obj.division();
  }
